# My First Post 

## Introducing myself

Hello! :wave: My name is Isabelle Martin - I am currently a 3rd year biological sciences undergraduate studying at Durham University. As of right now, I am approaching the end of my year abroad in Japan at Osaka University, in which I am conducting a research placement as part of the ‘FrontierLab’ exchange scheme at the Institute for Protein Research. いらっしゃいませ! :japan:

Throughout my course at Durham, I have studied a wide range of biological subjects - including ecology, physiology, behaviour, molecular, and plant biology, just to name a few! Over the years, I’ve found that I have a strong interest in evolution, particularly the genetic processes that underlie it, leading me to develop interest in molecular biology. This was the basis for my intentions on my year abroad - to learn and practice molecular biology in a research environment.  

My first placement here was in a molecular biology lab, focusing on the processes regarding homologous recombination, particularly those surrounding the RAD51 protein, involved in repairing damaged DNA. My long-standing aspiration after graduation was to break into academic research, and given my interests in genetics, this role seemed absolutely perfect for me! I strongly appreciated the lab for welcoming me, and the guidance of my supervisors. However, I found that, for a number of reasons, the wet lab environment wasn’t for me:

* Difficulty adjusting to irregular and long hours 
* Monotony and lack of automation of tasks 
* The fickle nature of yeast cells!
* Balancing multiple experiments at once 

Despite my struggle adapting to the wet lab environment, I found that I thrived in the data analysis aspects. My favourite parts were crunching genetic data, running statistics and producing graphs based on the data that I had collected! I would volunteer to do the data analysis as often as I could - a noble sacrifice that I would oh-so-happily take. My computational biology knowledge, up until this point, was rather basic. I was fortunately taught the basics of R and statistics as part of my course, so I had a springboard to jump off of. But, I knew I wanted to learn more, and the bioinformatics opportunities in that lab were very limited. So, something had to change. 

## Pivoting to computational biology 

Having to come to terms with the fact that I didn’t want to work in a wet lab - or perhaps even academia - was very difficult. It was all I had ever wanted to do, and was something I wanted to pursue at Masters level. I contemplated all the careers that I could pivot into - medicine, engineering, data science? I was overwhelmed with information, and they all seemed completely out of my depth, and so far from what I knew. I was at a loss for where to go. 

By chance, I stumbled upon a video by the channel, [Genomics with Georgia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJCFh6s1r7Ve0ygMlUZR8w), in which she outlined her pivot from biology to bioinformatics. Her story resonated with me - she was in a similar boat as to I was now, and pivoted to bioinformatics. She addressed my fears - the feeling that I wasn’t knowledgeable enough for computer science - and showed that it is entirely possible to change fields. Additionally, my biological knowledge and skills gained through the wet lab experience would actually be valuable; an understanding of how results are generated could only benefit me when analysing them. Plus, more transferable skills, such as time management, generating workflows and devising my own methods of study would greatly help me when transferring fields. 

I consulted my advisor, and numerous other points of contact, from both Durham University and Osaka University. I was surprised to see how supportive and encouraging they were for me to pivot into bioinformatics, something that seemed so intalgable to me. So, I contacted and successfully transferred into a computational biology lab for my second semester!

## My goals 

My goals, as of right now, are to develop my skills in computational biology :computer:. I find that the more I learn, the more I realise how little I know! But, to break it down more clearly, I want to develop a firm understanding of R, Python and Bash, in order to conduct analyses on molecular data. I also want to improve my understanding of maths and statistics. Finally, I also want to develop a more holistic understanding of the programming world, not just regarding biology. Hence, my ventures into Git, and this very blog! :pencil2:

This blog will serve as a record of my journey into the bioinformatics world, serving as useful documentation for me, and to demonstrate how a pivot into bioinformatics is very much attainable as a biologist. I aim to provide regular updates on what I have learnt and how I have learnt it, to make my research more easily reproducible by any readers that stumble upon it! And, perhaps more personally, this blog will hopefully motivate me to commit to pursuing bioinformatics. Admittedly, it is scary - I know so little about it, and placing this much weight on it as a career path may be unwise. What I do know though, is that I enjoy bioinformatics at the moment, and that’s enough for me. Join me on this journey into the unknown! :grin:
